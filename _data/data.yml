    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I believe that the essence of the undergraduate study is a kind of comprehensive development and exploration.
        After two years of engineering career and various attempts during college life, my life ambition is no longer a technical realization, 
        but a study of the data policy, the overall social policy and institutional innovation, there are numerous technologies based on scientific knowledge.
        How to integrate these technologies according to actual situations, and make it better and better for everyone, is the overall trend, which is more needed now and in the future. 
        As for me, a person doing scientific research at this stage can be very limited in his efforts on the natural sciences, and a good self-improving system (such as a scientific project research system) can double, even triple the benefits. 
        With the further innovation and development of information technology, the advent of the big-data era, making more reasonable decisions based on data to improve the current irrational institutional system, promoting social change and further progress is undoubtedly more suitable for my dream to become a senior think tank consultant.
        With the new technology that represents the future society:data science, blockchain, machine learning, etc., and the search for how these technologies can better benefit people and advance the science of social progress, I decidedly chose data scientist & Public policy researcher as my career.
        The process of our development is so unbalanced, then, who will be the guide?
